#  Graph Neural Networks for Protein-Ligand Interaction Interpretation

##  Overview
This project focuses on predicting protein–ligand binding interactions using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It aims to model molecular structures as graphs and learn interaction patterns for drug discovery applications.

Protein–ligand interactions are fundamental in drug design, as they determine how a drug molecule binds to its target protein.

---

##  Objectives
- Predict binding affinity between protein and ligand
- Represent molecules as graphs (nodes = atoms, edges = bonds/interactions)
- Capture spatial and chemical relationships using GNN
- Interpret important features influencing binding

---

##  Methodology

### 🔹 Graph Representation
- Protein and ligand converted into graph structures
- Nodes: atoms with features (type, charge, hybridization)
- Edges: bonds or distance-based interactions

### 🔹 Model
- Graph Neural Network (GNN)
- Message Passing mechanism
- Fully connected layers for prediction

GNNs work by passing information between nodes to learn structural relationships.
